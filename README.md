# RViz Experiments

A collection of experiments I did regarding the ROS (Robot Operating System) tool RViz.  
Maybe you were looking for something related and they are of some use to you.  
Or you're just stalking my GitHub page in which case I say Hi.  

The two experimental packages were tested with Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS Kinetic.
